# <workday-calendar>

## Description

-I was motivated to build an intuitive web app workday calendar utilizing html, javaScript, bootstrap, jQuery and moment js.

-I built this project to gain a deeper understanding of these libraries and to deepend my understanding of javaScript.

-This calendar allows the user to view the current workday, easily asses what time it is according to the calendar, view tasks that were previously saved, and save new tasks in different hour blocks.

-I learned a lot about jQuery, especially callback functions. I learned how to style elements with bootstrap. I learned how to refer to, dipslay and use moment js on a page. I learned how to decide whether it's better to create elements statically or dynamically. I learned how to dynamically alter elements. I learned how to save into and retrieve from local storage.

## Installation

Click on the link to visit the web app: https://mentaltemple.github.io/workday-calendar/

## Usage

The calendar will display the current day, along with time blocks for the current work day. The current hour is highlighted in red, the future hours are highlighted in green, while the past hours are grayed out. User can click on a time block, enter text, click save and the data will be retireved and displayed upon page reload until local storage is cleard.
